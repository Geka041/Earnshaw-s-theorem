# Earnshaw-s-theorem

Hello everyone.
I would like to present you my idea.
I have been interested in magnets and their properties for a very long time. On the Internet, I found information that, using only ferromagnets, it is impossible to stably hold an object in a gravitational field. This is Earnshaw's theorem.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnshaw%27s_theorem
When studying this issue, I experimentally found the necessary combination of neodymium magnets that refutes this theorem.
I want to put together a team to create a new cryptocurrency that will be tied to this invention. And in the future, all products that will use the levitation of permanent magnets will only sell for this currency.
My first step is to put together a team that will start building the project. Therefore, if you think you can help in any way (developing a new cryptocurrency, developing a website, managing a team, etc.), please contact me for a discussion honcharyevhen@gmail.com.
You can also support the project ETH 0x974C0288BDa79CdB8ba437E28122A29551bC03D4
